Description: general purpose WebRTC server/gateway
 janus is a general purpose WebRTC server/gateway
 with a minimal footprint.
 .
 As such, it doesn't provide any functionality per se
 other than implementing the means to set up
 a WebRTC media communication with a browser or application,
 exchanging JSON messages with it over different transports,
 and relaying RTP/RTCP and messages between clients
 and the server-side application logic they're attached to.
 Any specific feature/application is provided
 by server side plugins,
 that browsers can then contact via the server
 to take advantage of the functionality they provide.
 .
 Example of such plugins can be implementations of applications
 like echo tests, conference bridges, media recorders,
 SIP gateways and the like.

Description: image processing system good for very large ones (dev)
 VIPS is an image processing system designed with efficiency in mind.
 It is good with large images (ones that larger than the amount of RAM in
 your machine), and for working with colour.  It can perform many
 image manipulation tasks much faster than other packages such as
 ImageMagick and the GIMP and includes some special features such as
 creating single "mosaic" images from multiple parts.
 .
 VIPS consists of two main components: an image processing library
 with some command-line tools and a spreadsheet-like graphical user
 interface.  The graphical interface is available in the nip2 package.
 .
 This package includes all development files needed to compile
 applications that use the vips library.
